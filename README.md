# UI Design Sample React Project

This project is a sample react app for Professor Smith's UI Design React Lecture.

Each branch of this repository is a "version" of the project that corresponds to the steps taken within the lecture to create this app.

## Here is a breakdown of each version of the project:

| Version (branch name)  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **master**  | Clean, freshly made, new React App. This is the file structure expected after running the `npx create-react-app` command.  |
| **basic_html**  | Basic HTML and CSS static version of the page. No React. |
| **version-0.5**  | Static React version of the app after copying and pasting the existing HTML and CSS from the HTML and CSS files into the React project. |
| **version-1**  | Static React version of the app with hard-coded data. |
| **version-2**  | Dynamic React version of the app using variables and dynamic rendering of lists. No functionality. |
| **version-3**  | Dynamic React version of the app using state to add functionality to the app.  |
