# UI Design Sample React Project

This project is a sample react app for Professor Smith's UI Design React Lecture.

Each branch of the project is a "version" of the project that corresponds to the steps taken within the lecture to create this app.

Here is a breakdown of each version of the project:

Version 0.5: Basic HTML and CSS static version of the page. No React.

Version 1: Static React version of the app with hard-coded data.

version 2: Dynamic React version of the app using variables and dynamic rendering of lists. No functionality.

Version 3: Dynamic React version of the app using state to add functionality to the app.
